      %ul.build
        %ul
          %li
            %b Infrastructure as Code
          %ul

            %li
              Meant
              %b
                %u any

              %b
                %u all
              the things
        %ul
          %li

          %ul
            %li Nodes were faster (create/replace)
            %li Configuration knowledge in code
        %ul
          %li
            %b Work to be done
          %ul
            %li Still snowflaking resources
            %li Still too many bus factors
